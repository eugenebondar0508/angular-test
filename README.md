Checking the initial skills: Angular, core, common, router

Task
Implement an application that can display the following pages:

/ - home
/login - login and password entry page
/news - news page (any information of the same type)
Just show some 	
/profile - a page with free text, unavailable without authorization
On the site, in the header or basement, implement the links:

To the main (/)
News (/ news)
https://newsapi.org/ - use this open api to show any random news. 
Profile (/ profile)
If the user clicks on the "profile" page and he is not "authorized" - throw on the / login page

The login form (/ login) accepts fake data:

username: admin
password: 12345

If other data is entered, the following messages are displayed:

The username or password you entered is incorrect

If the correct data is entered, then redirect to the / profile page

User authorization information can be stored in localStorage, with a simple true / false parameter. The database does not need to be implemented. Application parts should be separated into modules, use lazy loading where it makes sense. 
Also feel free to use Firebase to solve the authentication part, if task is to easy for you.


Design (design) is not important just use some css framework like (https://bulma.io/ or https://getbootstrap.com/). Make it so that you can comfortably watch an example in a browser. 


Conditions
Issue a code on GitHub with a sensible Readme.md.

P.S. If you are unable to do part of the task, then send the solution anyway, indicating what exactly did not work out and why.
